This is a user modification project using the Paradox Game Crusader Kings 2, which will try to capture the universe presented in Jagex's MMORPG, Old School Runescape.
Two days ago, that is 2019-07-08, I had no idea how to start a user modification and have now moved my project to GitHub which I admittadly do not know how to use, but that's all in the learning process I assume.


It is is my hope that eventually someone with more experience in user modification could contact me and help me and contribute in realizing my project so it can eventually be enjoyed by everybody.
